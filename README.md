This bug demonstrates the unexpected behavior of type coercion in JavaScript. When adding a number and a string, JavaScript performs string concatenation instead of numerical addition. This can lead to unexpected results and errors in programs. The solution involves explicitly converting the string to a number before performing the addition operation.
